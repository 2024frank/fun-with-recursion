# This function recursively draws bubbles on a canvas
#
# Parameters:
# x: the x-coordinate of the center of the new bubble
# y: the y-coordinate of the center of the new bubble
# r: the radius of the new bubble to draw
# depth: the current depth of recursion

        northwest_x = x - r
        northwest_y = y - r
        bubbles(northwest_x, northwest_y, r//2, depth - 1)

        # recursively draw another pattern in the top right (northeast)
        northeast_x = x + r
        northeast_y = y - r
        bubbles(northeast_x, northeast_y, r//2, depth - 1)
